Snake Game is a classic and addictive 2D arcade game built in Unity, inspired by the popular snake games of the past. Players control a snake, guiding it around the game area to collect food and grow longer. However, they must be careful not to collide with obstacles or the snake's own tail, as doing so will end the game.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Control the Snake**: Players can control the snake's movement using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or their equivalent on-screen controls.
- **Collect Food**: The primary objective is to guide the snake to eat food items scattered throughout the game area. Each time the snake consumes food, it grows longer.
- **Avoid Obstacles and Tail**: Players must avoid running into the game boundaries or the snake's own tail, as it will result in the game ending.
- **Speed and Challenge**: As the game progresses and the snake grows longer, the challenge increases, making it harder to avoid obstacles and navigate the game area.
- **Score Points**: Players score points for each food item consumed. The longer the snake, the higher the score.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with a boundary or its tail, displaying a game-over screen with the player's final score.
- **Restart**: Players have the option to restart the game from the game-over screen and try to achieve a higher score.
